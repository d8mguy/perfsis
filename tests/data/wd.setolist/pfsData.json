{"cube":{"ident":"setolist","description":" Study set.subset operation for Gomap vs olist implementations. Use three parameters: (1) the size of the main set; (2) the size of the subset; (2) the probability that the tested subset is actually a subset of the main one. The last 2 parameters matter because as either gets smaller, the map implementation, which has to loop over full element tests, has less to do and hence, gets potentially faster.","params":[{"ident":"setSize","explanation":"number of random items in main set","unit":"","elements":["10000","50000","100000"]},{"ident":"otherSize","explanation":"number of random items in set tested for subset","unit":"","elements":["50","5000"]},{"ident":"yesprob","explanation":"percent of cases where subset is true","unit":"","elements":["5","40","80"]}],"outputs":[{"ident":"avg time","explanation":"avg time to calc subset","unit":"microsecond"},{"ident":"min time","explanation":"min time to calc subset","unit":"microsecond"},{"ident":"max time","explanation":"max time to calc subset","unit":"microsecond"},{"ident":"yesFract","explanation":"fraction of trials responding yes","unit":"percent"}]},"substns":[],"contexts":[{"key":"runtime","value":["2021 M1 Macbook Pro"]},{"key":"compiler","value":["2023/12/27"]}],"version":0}
